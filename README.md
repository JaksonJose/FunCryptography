# FunCryptography
Cryptography program based on teenager encoding play.


This is a program based on the thing I used to play when I was teenager.

It intends to get the alphabet vowel and turn it into 'k' coding system. The letter "a" is represented by a "k" letter with one dashed over it . The "e" letter is represented by a "k" letter with two dashed over it and so on.  While I was building this program I inverted the sequences and replaced the dashed by a number from 1 to 5. We have 5 vowels represented by 'k' letter followed by numbers from 1 to 5. a = k5, e = k4, i = k3,  o = k2, u = k1.

Hope you all like it. I just wrote this for training python language and improve my programming skills.


## Instructions

The program is based on **menu sequences**, first you're going to see a **MAIN MENU**. Type the number of the option you want.
If you want to write a text on screen program choose the **Write a text**. When you finish to type your text press Enter on your keyboard and follow the menu instructions.

If you want encode or decode a text typed into a file you need to **put the file text into the FunCryptography folder.** The file must be a txt file.
