Cryptography program based on teenager encoding play.


This is a program based on the thing I used to play when I was teenager.

It intends to get the alphabet vowel and turn it into 'k' coding system. Where the letter "a" was represented by a "k" letter with one dashed over it . The "e" letter was represented by a "k" letter with two dashed over it and so on.  While I was building this program I inverted the sequences. So we have 5 vowel and each number represent a vowel.
a = 5, e = 4, i = 3,  o = 2, u = 1. And the letter 'K' is the marker to show you that it's a encode system.

Hope you all like it. I just write this for training python language and improve my programming skills.
