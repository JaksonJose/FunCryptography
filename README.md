# FunCryptography
Cryptography program based on encoding play.


This is a program based on the thing I used to play when I was teenager. I developed this code for training Python language.

Iit intends to make the alphabet vowel to turn into the 'k' coding system. the letter "a" is represented by a "k" letter with one dashed over it. The "e" letter is represented by the "k" letter with two dashed over it and so on.

While this program was developed I replaced the dashed by the numbers from 1 to 5 backward. For exemple, the 5 vowels of the alphabet was replaced by 'k' letter followed by numbers from 1 to 5. a = k5, e = k4, i = k3,  o = k2, u = k1.


## Instructions

The program is based on **menu sequences**, first, you're going to see a **MAIN MENU**. Type the number of the option you want.  
If you want to write a text on the screen choose the **Write a text**. When you finish typing your text press Enter on your keyboard and follow the menu instructions.

If you want to encode or decode a text typed into an external file you need to **put the file text into the FunCryptography folder.** The file must be a txt file.
